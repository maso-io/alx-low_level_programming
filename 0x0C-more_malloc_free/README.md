#### Memory Managment in C

This segment focuses on how to use dynamic memory allocation and memory
management in a C program. It introduces the following areas:

    1. malloc(size_t b) for memory allocation
    3. calloc(int n, size_t b) for allocation and initialization
    2. realloc(void *, size_t b) for memory reallocation
    4. free(void *) for memory management

It also introduces `valgrind` for memory validation and management.<br>
We also see the introduction of `exit()`  codes, to communicate the behavior of how the program ended.<br>
